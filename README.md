* Float8 [training](torchao/float8/README.md) and [inference](https://docs.pytorch.org/ao/main/generated/torchao.quantization.Float8DynamicActivationFloat8WeightConfig.html) for speedups without compromising accuracy
* [MX training and inference](torchao/prototype/mx_formats/README.md), provides MX tensor formats based on native PyTorch MX dtypes (prototype)
* [Low precision MoE training](torchao/prototype/moe_training/README.md) provides training speedups with comparable numerics to bfloat16 training.
* [Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)](torchao/quantization/qat/README.md) for mitigating quantization degradation
* [Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)](torchao/quantization/README.md) for int4, int8, fp6 etc, with matching kernels targeting a variety of backends including CUDA, ARM CPU, and XNNPACK
* [Sparsity](torchao/sparsity/README.md), includes different techniques such as 2:4 sparsity and block sparsity

Check out our [docs](https://docs.pytorch.org/ao/main/) for more details!

## ðŸ”Ž Inference

TorchAO delivers substantial performance gains with minimal code changes:

- **Int4 weight-only**: [1.73x speedup with 65% less memory](https://huggingface.co/pytorch/gemma-3-12b-it-INT4) for Gemma3-12b-it on H100 with slight impact on accuracy
- **Float8 dynamic quantization**: [1.5-1.6x speedup on gemma-3-27b-it](https://huggingface.co/pytorch/gemma-3-27b-it-FP8/blob/main/README.md#results-h100-machine) and [1.54x and 1.27x speedup on Flux.1-Dev* and CogVideoX-5b respectively](https://github.com/sayakpaul/diffusers-torchao) on H100 with preserved quality
- **Int8 activation quantization and int4 weight quantization**: Quantized Qwen3-4B running with 14.8 tokens/s with 3379 MB memory usage on iPhone 15 Pro through [ExecuTorch](https://huggingface.co/pytorch/Qwen3-4B-INT8-INT4#running-in-a-mobile-app)
- **Int4 + 2:4 Sparsity**: [2.37x throughput with 67.7% memory reduction](torchao/sparsity/README.md) on Llama-3-8B

Following is our recommended flow for quantization and deployment:
```python
from transformers import TorchAoConfig, AutoModelForCausalLM
from torchao.quantization import Float8DynamicActivationFloat8WeightConfig, PerRow

# Create quantization configuration
quantization_config = TorchAoConfig(quant_type=Float8DynamicActivationFloat8WeightConfig(granularity=PerRow()))

# Load and automatically quantize
quantized_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen3-32B",
    dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto",
    quantization_config=quantization_config
)
```

Alternative quantization API to use when the above doesn't work is `quantize_` API in [quick start guide](https://docs.pytorch.org/ao/main/quick_start.html).

Serving with vllm on 1xH100 machine:
```shell
# Server
VLLM_DISABLE_COMPILE_CACHE=1 vllm serve pytorch/Qwen3-32B-FP8 --tokenizer Qwen/Qwen3-32B -O3
```

```shell
# Client
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "model": "pytorch/Qwen3-32B-FP8",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Give me a short introduction to large language models."}
  ],
  "temperature": 0.6,
  "top_p": 0.95,
  "top_k": 20,
  "max_tokens": 32768
}'
```

We also support deployment to edge devices through ExecuTorch, for more detail, see [quantization and serving guide](https://docs.pytorch.org/ao/main/serving.html). We also release pre-quantized models [here](https://huggingface.co/pytorch).

## ðŸš… Training

### Quantization-Aware Training

Post-training quantization can result in a fast and compact model, but may also lead to accuracy degradation. We recommend exploring Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) to overcome this limitation, especially for lower bit-width dtypes such as int4. In collaboration with [TorchTune](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/blob/main/recipes/quantization.md#quantization-aware-training-qat), we've developed a QAT recipe that demonstrates significant accuracy improvements over traditional PTQ, recovering **96% of the accuracy degradation on hellaswag and 68% of the perplexity degradation on wikitext** for Llama3 compared to post-training quantization (PTQ). For more details, please refer to the [QAT README](torchao/quantization/qat/README.md) and the [original blog](https://pytorch.org/blog/quantization-aware-training/):

```python
from torchao.quantization import quantize_, Int8DynamicActivationInt4WeightConfig
from torchao.quantization.qat import QATConfig

# prepare
base_config = Int8DynamicActivationInt4WeightConfig(group_size=32)
quantize_(my_model, QATConfig(base_config, step="prepare"))

# train model (not shown)

# convert
quantize_(my_model, QATConfig(base_config, step="convert"))
```

Users can also combine LoRA + QAT to speed up training by [1.89x](https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/t/speeding-up-qat-by-1-89x-with-lora/2700) compared to vanilla QAT using this [fine-tuning recipe](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/blob/main/recipes/qat_lora_finetune_distributed.py).


### Quantized training

[torchao.float8](torchao/float8) implements training recipes with the scaled float8 dtypes, as laid out in https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05433. With ``torch.compile`` on, current results show throughput speedups of up to **1.5x on up to 512 GPU / 405B parameter count scale** ([details](https://pytorch.org/blog/training-using-float8-fsdp2/)):

```python
from torchao.float8 import convert_to_float8_training
convert_to_float8_training(m)
```

Our float8 training is integrated into [TorchTitan's pre-training flows](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtitan/blob/main/docs/float8.md) so users can easily try it out. For more details, check out these blog posts about our float8 training support:
* [Accelerating Large Scale Training and Convergence with PyTorch Float8 Rowwise on Crusoe 2K H200s](https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerating-large-scale-training-and-convergence-with-pytorch-float8-rowwise-on-crusoe-2k-h200s/)

<details>
  <summary>Other features (sparse training, memory efficient optimizers)</summary>

### Sparse Training

We've added support for semi-structured 2:4 sparsity with **6% end-to-end speedups on ViT-L**. Full blog [here](https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerating-neural-network-training/). The code change is a 1 liner with the full example available [here](torchao/sparsity/training/):

```python
from torchao.sparsity.training import SemiSparseLinear, swap_linear_with_semi_sparse_linear
swap_linear_with_semi_sparse_linear(model, {"seq.0": SemiSparseLinear})
```

### Memory-efficient optimizers

Optimizers like ADAM can consume substantial GPU memory - 2x as much as the model parameters themselves. TorchAO provides two approaches to reduce this overhead:

**1. Quantized optimizers**: Reduce optimizer state memory by 2-4x by quantizing to lower precision

```python
from torchao.optim import AdamW8bit, AdamW4bit, AdamWFp8
optim = AdamW8bit(model.parameters()) # replace with Adam4bit and AdamFp8 for the 4 / fp8 versions
```
Our quantized optimizers are implemented in just a few hundred lines of PyTorch code and compiled for efficiency. While slightly slower than specialized kernels, they offer an excellent balance of memory savings and performance. See detailed [benchmarks here](https://github.com/pytorch/ao/tree/main/torchao/optim).

**2. CPU offloading**: Move optimizer state and gradients to CPU memory

For maximum memory savings, we support [single GPU CPU offloading](https://github.com/pytorch/ao/tree/main/torchao/optim#optimizer-cpu-offload) that efficiently moves both gradients and optimizer state to CPU memory. This approach can **reduce your VRAM requirements by 60%** with minimal impact on training speed:

```python
optim = CPUOffloadOptimizer(model.parameters(), torch.optim.AdamW, fused=True)
optim.load_state_dict(ckpt["optim"])
```

## For Developers

### Composability
`torch.compile`: A key design principle for us is composability - any custom dtype or memory layout should work with our compiler. We enable kernel implementations in PyTorch, CUDA, C++, or Triton. This allows researchers and engineers to start with high-level dtype and layout logic in pure PyTorch, then progressively optimize performance by implementing lower-level kernels as needed, while maintaining compatibility with the compile infrastructure.

[FSDP2](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtitan/blob/main/docs/fsdp.md): Historically most quantization has been done for inference, there is now a thriving area of research combining distributed algorithms and quantization.

The best example we have combining the composability of lower bit dtype with compile and fsdp is [NF4](torchao/dtypes/nf4tensor.py) which we used to implement the [QLoRA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvRl4ansfCg) algorithm. So if you're doing research at the intersection of this area we'd love to hear from you.

Our framework makes it straightforward to add tensor parallel support to your custom quantized tensor subclass. Check out our [tensor parallel tutorial](tutorials/developer_api_guide/tensor_parallel.py) to see how a quantized tensor subclass can be extended to support column and row-wise tensor sharding while maintaining compatibility with `torch.compile`.

### Custom Kernels

We've added support for authoring and releasing [custom ops](./torchao/csrc/) that do not graph break with `torch.compile()`. We have a few examples you can follow

1. [fp6](torchao/dtypes/floatx/README.md) for 2x faster inference over fp16 with an easy to use API `quantize_(model, fpx_weight_only(3, 2))`
2. [2:4 Sparse Marlin GEMM](https://github.com/pytorch/ao/pull/733) 2x speedups for FP16xINT4 kernels even at batch sizes up to 256
3. [int4 tinygemm unpacker](https://github.com/pytorch/ao/pull/415) which makes it easier to switch quantized backends for inference

If you believe there's other CUDA kernels we should be taking a closer look at please leave a comment on [this issue](https://github.com/pytorch/ao/issues/697) or feel free to contribute directly to the repo.
