    plain means the format that quantized Tensor data lays out elements in Tensor sequentially,
    for example:                                                                                                                                                                                                          for a Tensor of shape (4, 6):
    a_0_0, a_0_1, ..., a_0_5,
    ...
    a_3_0, a_3_1, ..., a_3_5

    Note that it's different for different dtypes, for example for int4, we will
    pack two adjacent int4 elements into one uint8/int8 value for plain packing format
