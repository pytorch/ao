class PerToken(Granularity):

    This granularity type calculates a different set of quantization parameters

    For example, if the input tensor has shape [2, 3, 4], then there are 6 tokens
    with 4 elements each, and we will calculate 6 sets of quantization parameters,
    one for each token.

    If the input tensor has only two dimensions, e.g. [8, 16], then this is
    equivalent to `PerAxis(axis=0)`, which yields 8 sets of quantization parameters.
